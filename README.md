Just a very simple traffic simulation made with UE5 in a few days.

Features:
- functional traffic lights, speed limit zones and stop signs
- AI controlled cars that follow the traffic rules and drive along predefined pathes (splines)
- a player-controlled car with an UI that informs the player if he broke traffic rules
